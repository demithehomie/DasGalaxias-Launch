What can we make with artificial intelligence? What types of problems can we solve? This repository will have great content, code, scientifical articles about how we can solve problems with artificial intelligence. 

Being more specific, we'll start by solving mobility problems at the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 

1 - Drones, flying cars, and VTOL vehicles at Rio de Janeiro
2 - Full self-driving cars at Rio de Janeiro
3 - Can we see imperfections at the roads through AI?
4 - AI for small and mini vehicles, at Rio de Janeiro.

Why Rio? Well, It's a city that has specific challenges, so if we can solve them here, we hope them to be solved from almost anywhere.
